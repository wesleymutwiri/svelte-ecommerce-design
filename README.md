# Svelte Ecommerce Design

This is a simple trial at creating an ecommerce site called potted plants using the UI design from [Anastasia Petrenko's Design of an online potted plants store on Behance](https://www.behance.net/gallery/95413171/Online-store-of-potted-plants). The UI uses basic HTML, CSS for the UI design and svelte for basic interactions and animations. Routify is used for client side routing of the site. A [basic golang backend](https://github.com/wesleymutwiri/gocommerce/tree/wes-dev) has been created to deal with basic authentication on the profile page of the site.
